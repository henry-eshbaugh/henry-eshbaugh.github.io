Welcome to my brag sheet! As part of coursework for an industrial placement, I am required to put together a portfolio of projects I have worked on. I'm not much of a visual person, so, enjoy a comprehensive wall of text!

Spacecraft magnetometry
=====
In the summers, I work at the Space Magnetometer Laboratory, with a focus on COTS anisotropic magnetorestive (AMR) sensor electronics for space weather applications, including the characterization of magnetic multipoles of interplanetary spacecraft, and scientific data from small, low-power, low-cost craft such as cubesats and nanosatellites.

Specifically, I work on RadCube, a joint venture from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Center for Energy Research (MTA EK) and the European Space Agency; the primary scientific payloads are MTA EK's particle sensor and our magnetometer. We are moving towards a critical design review in late 2018 and delivery of the flight magnetometer next year; our launch is scheduled for 2020. I am responsible for the design and calibration of the electronics for the sensor, including scripting support software and design of the board.

I have also spent time working on various other projects for the lab, including a fully-digital AMR sensor proof-of-concept (implementing the front-end analog signal chain on an FPGA), and various debug tools for the JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) magnetometer (J-MAG); specifically, I designed a simulator board for the J-MAG instrument control board, featuring LVDS buffers and off-board connectors mimicking the design of the proper instrument, such that collaborating institutions (the University of Braunshweig, and the Austrian Academy of Sciences at Graz) could debug their hardware.

I have also developed a small but powerful Python framework called Magpie, which allows for easy management and live graphing of test data. This data is specified to arrive appended to CSVs; arbitrary transforms on the data can be specified, and particular data columns (or transforms thereof) can be redirected to graphs on a web page in an arbitrary layout. This framework relies heavily on the Bokeh framework; however, while Bokeh may need hundreds of lines of code to specify a single interface to test data, a quick script to serve such web pages amounts to a few lines of Python with the Magpie framework. Though initially developed for JUICE debugging two years ago, I am currently using this framework to test and calibrate the RadCube magnetometer.

Living Observatory
=====
While in high school, I participated in the Living Observatory project in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The site is a former large-volume cranberry bog, which was taken out of production and is now undergoing a process of ecological restoration into a wetlands habitat. Ordinary duties included botany - identifying and removing invasive plant species, work in a greenhouse, and so on. The site is a hotbed for ecological research; during my time there, I assisted in geohydrological surveys of the site, including OFDR distributed temperature sensing, well-water isotope sampling, and numerous other scientific tasks. I even got a [shout-out](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1161&context=masters_theses_2) in the acknowledgements section of Danielle Hare's master's thesis!

As part of this experience, I spent time at the MIT Media Laboratory, where I assisted in the development and assembly of prototype sensor nodes deployed around the property. These nodes exist in a mesh network, and include various sensors of interest (volumetric water content of soil, temperature, humidity, ambient light, electrolyte sensors, etc). This experience was formative and pivotal to my decision to pursue electronics engineering in university.

Programming experience; personal and university projects
=====
I nagged my dad into buying my first textbook on programming (in the Python language) at the age of 12. I am something of a polyglot and have since become familiar with (in order of experience) C/++, x86(-64)/ARM/AVR assembly languages, Java, Haskell, Common Lisp, F# (though, between you and me, I resent .NET), Bash, MATLAB/Octave, and Julia.


Virtualization obfuscation
-----
Interesting personal projects included an attempt at submitting a paper to DEF CON in the field of binary obfuscation. I was interested in virtualization obfuscation (in which machines are emulated, such that reverse engineers would have to understand both the target architecture and the emulated architecture in order to understand the functionality of the program) - specifically, my proposal was on the subject of recursive virtualization obfuscation - in which machines emulate machines emulating machines emulating machines, creating layers that must be peeled back before the reversing can conclude. The core goal of binary obfuscation, of course, is to frustrate your opponent - though such approaches are necessarily flawed, as with enough time, the program will be understood, the concept is to make the program much more frustrating to reverse than other programs. Indeed, virtualization obfuscation is presently employed on Blu-Ray players to protect their encryption schemes. A cornerstone of the project would be auto-generating random computer architectures with a template assembly language implemented in the flex/bison lexer/parser generator framework, and porting a fully-featured compiler back-end, such as LLVM, to such a "template" architecture. In this way, multiple different secret architectures could be created.

My paper was rejected; according to the referees, they prefer speakers to be 21+. However, one reviewer called the submission "bad-ass."

Real-time pitch identification via Fourier transforms: naive DSP
-----

The next year, for my high-school science fair project, I developed a program called GSynth, which sought to identify pitch in real-time from stringed instruments and emit MIDI data to a "plug-board" server such as JACK. I ran my bass guitar through an external amplifier into my computer's line-in; the samples were zero-padded, and Fourier transforms were taken. To eliminate the overtone series and isolate the fundamental frequency, the spectrum was downsampled by factors of two and three; these three resulting spectra were multiplied together to produce a large peak at the fundamental. A peak-detection algorithm then ran to identify the corresponding frequency and associate it with a musical note. Finally, the note was output to the JACK server as MIDI, into a DAW such as Ardour. The code was fully multithreaded and written in C for optimal performance, using a pipelined flip-buffer architecture. Even in such a Spartan, verbose language, the program was less than 1000 lines of code.

Though the program had much promise for electric guitars (which I did not test with), the key flaw in the plan was the tradeoff between latency and granularity of frequencies in the fast Fourier transform. Musicians need a low-latency signal path; however, such low latency means that notes which are close together in the frequency domain are difficult to discriminate. This was the conclusion of my science fair presentation; the reviewers were not happy, but my physics teacher was quite proud. I next encountered these results four years later, during my third-year digital signal processing module. Discussion with my professor has ignited interest in the so-called "zoom transform," which may produce better results. Unfortunately, the code was on an old computer and is now lost.

Education
=====
In high school, I completed 9 AP modules, earning '5's on each - in Calculus AB, Calc BC, Physics B, Physics with calculus: mechanics, Physics with calculus: electromagnetism, English literature, English language, US history, and Computer Science A (in the Java language). I completed coursework for a tenth (AP biology), but exam clash forced me to favor the Physics C papers. I was recognized as the top student in AP biology. I was active on the debate team - my best showing was breaking to quarterfinals at the NJFL national tournament in the 8th grade. I was also the news editor for the newspaper; I was awarded the American Scholastic Press Association award for outstanding non-school-related article, for my coverage of the shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. I studied Latin for five years - obtaining three perfect papers and two gold medals on the National Latin Exam.

University projects
=====
In second year, I collaborated with a team to work on a tactile-braille-signing glove. The braille cell is made of six points, each indented or left flat, essentially encoding a chracter in six bits. With deaf-blind individuals, conversation proceeds via stimulation of six points in the hand. We built a small glove with motors to do this stimulation.

I take great responsibility for a major failure of the project - I was inexperienced with PCB design at the time, and attempted to solder the device together (using surface-mount 0603 resistors and SOT-23 transistors, not as an array, but as individual transistors) using large irons in the labs. Naturally, this ended quite badly. Due to funding limitations, we only had a single PCB; we also built the thing far too late, and at that point the turnaround time to a new PCB was past the deadline for the project. In proper student fashion, we hacked the circuit together on perfboard the night before the presentation. I am, by-and-large, responsible for this failure, and have learned from this experience the importance of time management and the dangers of hubris (my CAD skills were but fledgeling then).

In third year, I worked on a number of interesting courseworks. One included an IoT sleep monitor (we were randomly allocated an accelerometer); I pushed my group to develop our web end around Flask, such that raw/processed data could be trivially funneled into web pages using a RESTful API, thus greatly expanding the functionality of the device (from appliance monitor to networked electronic drum-head). In the same module, we implemented a motor controller that searched for nonces producing zeroes in SHA-256 hashes, a la Bitcoin mining - the idea was that the contradictory goals of real-time control and intense CPU demand would give a measure of the efficiency of the code.

Another included pipelining of a complicated floating-point expression including trigonometry within a sum, and a high (N>25,000) number of terms in the sum, on an FPGA - and integrating this sum with the Nios II soft processor. I was specifically interested in the evaluation of trigonometric functions in digital logic; I derived and implemented Chebyshev and Taylor series of the cosine function and evaluated them against the Verilog modules Alex had written for floating-point addition and multiplication - specifically, in their utilization of the FPGA's resources. Though slower to converge, the fixed-point CORDIC algorithm is far superior in this context, as the required floating-point hardware required for a fully-pipelined implementation (analytically determined by yours truly) was infeasible even for low-order expansions.

Finally, I self-proposed a Scheme interpreter (such are trivial to implement) for a functional programming module - I think Common Lisp is a beautiful language with an incredibly expressive syntax focusing on *homoiconicity* - that is, it is a language for operating on linked lists that is itself a notation for linked lists, and so it operates *on itself* ("metaprogramming") in a beautiful way. I wanted to implement a subset of R7RS scheme, specifically, which is small and well-defined - sample implementations under 500 lines of code are available online as proof of the viability of this idea. Unfortunately, my professor insisted that I was incapable of writing such a "difficult" program (for reasons that are unclear to me), and forced our group to implement an ARM assembler/emulator instead - this I did not want to do, as I considered it a rehash of the virtualization obfuscation work I had done some five years prior. Worse, he banned parser generators (which allow easy translation of EBNF defining the grammar of a language to the parsers that operate on the token stream), insisting that we use his clunky, ad-hoc parser (some 250-300 lines long, designed to break and try again when a label was encountered). At any rate, we wrote it, but I don't think it's much to brag about. Unfortuantely, by his wishes, the code lives in a private GitHub repo - but if it takes your prof hundreds of lines to implement an assembler parser in a functional language, and then tells you to reuse his code, you can be assured that it's not code you want to read anyways.

Extracurricular activities & teaching
=====
For the past two years, I have ran ICSEDS Electronics, the, um, electronics branch of the student space society at Imperial. Historically, we've been short on funding - so instead, I've taken the opportunity to lecture a condensed series on electronics design, including explanations of common circuits and when they're used (H-bridges, how to wire up a microcontroller, etc). Next year will be the culmination of this effort; I am preparing lectures that delve deeply into the challenges of electronics in space, including the effects of radiation on semiconductor, heater control, space weather instrumentation, and so on. Last year, a third-year group project and a final year project (FYP) were obtained by working on a rover for competition.

I am co-editor of the music section of *Felix*, Imperial's student newspaper. [My writing is available here](http://felixonline.co.uk/authors/he915/). Undoubtably the piece I am proudest of is [I, for one, hail our faceless corporate overlords](http://felixonline.co.uk/articles/2017-12-01-i-for-one-hail-our-faceless-corporate-overlords/), my five-star review of *Now That's What I Call Music! 98*.

Hobbies
=====
I enjoy reading (currently enjoying the hell out of *Gravity's Rainbow*, though the going is slow) and watching Netflix.
